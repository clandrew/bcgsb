# BASIC Computer Games for F256 SuperBASIC
This repository contains samples from the 1978 book "BASIC Computer Games", with some of them adapted to run on Foenix F256 SuperBASIC.

The following have been adapted:
* bunny.bas
* buzzword.bas
* love.bas
* stars.bas

To run in the FoenixIDE emulator in F256 board mode, they rely on F256 RNG emulation which was added with [this pull request](https://github.com/Trinity-11/FoenixIDE/pull/40).
